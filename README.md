# Machine Learning Project 04: Improved Hexameter AI

This an AI that predict the scansion of a line of Latin Hexameter Poetry.

# Instruction to run it

You need several packages installed first. Make sure that they are updated.
 ```bash
```

You will also need to install with homebrew:
Chrome WebDriver: For web automation functionality


Run the programs in this order
1) train a model
2) run Main

Make sure already have an Hexameter.co account before you run step 4

# Reasources used

- Used Flint AI to write most of the code. I gave ideas,  instructions, and pseudocode

# Metrical Pattern Encoding

- Hexameter patterns are encoded as 6-character strings:
 - D: Dactyl (— ∪ ∪) - long followed by two shorts
 - S: Spondee (— —) - two long syllables
- Example: DSSSDS = Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee
